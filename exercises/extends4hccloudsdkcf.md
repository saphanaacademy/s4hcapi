## Description

In this video sub-set we will be showing how to get started using the Cloud SDK for S/4HANA Cloud. We will create a simple Node.js application in the SAP Cloud Platform's Cloud Foundry environment. 

This app will consume data from the S/4HANA Cloud's Planned Orders API. A Communication Arrangment that we built in the Getting Started with the S/4HANA Cloud API's will be used in conjunction with an SCP Destination to provide the authentication between the two platforms.
